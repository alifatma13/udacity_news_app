# udacity_news_app
A news app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice.

Allows a user to get a list of published news by The Guardian (Newspaper) on a given topic using the the Guardian's news api in order to 
fetch results and display them to the user.

As a part of Udacity Nanodegree this app is created for practicing the Networking and local storage concepts in Android Mobile apps.

This practice app helped to learn the following:

Fetching data from an API using a class such as HttpUriRequest or HttpURLConnection.
Using an AsyncTaskLoader so that the network call occurs off the UI thread
Parsing a JSON response
Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
Providing appropriate messages to user by checking whether the device is connected to the internet or the response id empty.
Implementing Shared Preferences
